# HI-PONIC â€“ Your Automated Hydroponics Solution

## Introduction
HI-PONIC is an innovative project aimed at automating and monitoring hydroponics systems in real-time. The system leverages cloud computing and Machine learning to provide urban farmers with an efficient way to manage their hydroponics setups.

### HI-PONIC Backend
Description
HI-PONIC Backend is the core server-side component of the HI-PONIC project, which provides real-time monitoring and control for IoT-based hydroponic systems. This backend service is responsible for managing data from sensors, user authentication, and API integrations with various frontend applications.

## Architecture Overview
The system utilizes a microservices architecture deployed on Google Cloud Platform, ensuring scalability and reliability. Key components include:
- **Backend**: Developed using Node.js and Express.js.
- **Database**:
